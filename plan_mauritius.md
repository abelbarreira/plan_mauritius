## Destination

Travel to **Mauritius Island** :sunny:, :sunglasses:, :palm_tree:, :bikini:, :tropical_drink:. Yuhuuuu!!!

### Travel Requirements

- **Passport** must be valid for at least <font color="red">**6 months**</font>.
- EU COVID Vaccination Certificates.
- Negative PCR within 72h.

## Dates :calendar:

In total, **three weeks**, from **Friday, 4th of March** to **Sunday, 27th of March** of 2022.

It is Mauritius' shoulder season, which means less humid, lower prices, less visitors, perfect for diving/snorkeling, but raining expected.

## Plan

### <font color=blue>Vero's plan</font>

Vero gets the **three weeks** of holidays, to enjoy running around the island :running:...

### <font color=blue>Abel's plan</font>

Abel works the **first week** over there and then gets **two weeks** of holidays.
Abel can work from the Valid's office in the island or from the Apartment (in case Wifi is enough good).

Abel's office is in [NeXTeracom Tower 1 @ Ebene area](https://www.google.com/maps/place/NeXTeracom+Tower+1,+Quatre+Bornes,+Mauritius/@-20.2429762,57.4872387,18.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x217c5ae1d1f68fc9:0xf67722ad33dc19d!8m2!3d-20.2424442!4d57.4884947).

## Weather :sunny:

- [Reference 1](https://www.holiday-weather.com/mauritius/averages/march/)
- [Reference 2](https://www.thomascook.com/holidays/weather/indian-ocean/mauritius/march/)
- [Reference 3](https://mauritiusattractions.com/mauritius-rainfall-in-mauritius-i-111.html)

March is the **wet session** so we should expect a lot of rains, with good temperature and humidity. But this depends on the region.

- Please, read it directly in the [Reference 3](https://mauritiusattractions.com/mauritius-rainfall-in-mauritius-i-111.html).
- Please, read about [the different regions here](https://www.mauritius.io/locations).

March is cyclones season, so it can happen two things: either it rains all the time or it is really good weather (with 30 degrees), but nothing is assured since is cyclones season.

## Flights :airplane:

Travel to Mauritius through Paris (CDG, Charles de Gaulle Airport).

1. Book the flight from CPH to CDG on **Thursday, 3rd of March @ 9h30**, one way, about **314DKK** with Easyjet. It arrives at **11h35**.
2. Book the flight with Air Mauritius on **Friday, 3rd March @ 16h20** to **Thursday, 24th of March**. This cost **712€**. [Reference](https://booking.airmauritius.com/plnext/AirMauritiusDX/Override.action#/FPOW). It arrives at 7h35 on 25 March.
3. The idea is chose flexibility to the Air Mauritius flights so we can decide when to come back to Paris and stay there some days.
   1. Or, the another idea is buy the return flights already in Mauritius, when we have decided when and how we want to come back.

 Approximate budget is  **6.000DKK**.

So the plan can be as following:

- **First week**, from 4th to 12th, renting this apartment close to office [172€: 18 min to the office](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/35324192?adults=2&location=Mauritius&check_in=2022-03-02&check_out=2022-03-25&previous_page_section_name=1001&federated_search_id=f4e2ef97-9eb2-4a16-9fe7-f9cdba7aec6b).
  - So I can walk to work to the office.
  - But it is not close to the beach, so we have to see how/where we can reach the beach this week?
- **Second and Third weeks**, from 12th to 24th, [420€, in the Trou aux Biches, North](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1790970?check_out=2022-03-24&check_in=2022-03-12&adults=2&guests=2&s=42&unique_share_id=bcc9b008-a017-4d1e-85cd-bb8bbb01569b)

On average, the cost can be set in **600€ = 4.400 DKK**.

### Requirements

- Wifi.
- Parking Area for the Car.

<div class="page"/>

## Transportation :tractor:

Think how we are doing:

- From/To Airport
- Excursions / Visits
- From/To Valid Office (for visit or for working there one week).

### Renting Car

One week of simulation from 4th of March (10h00) to 11th of March (10h00), in the Airport.

- [172€: OLA, Perodua Axia with GPS and Assistance](https://www.olamauritius.com/en/step-3/?id=48&txtFromDate=04/03/2022&txtToDate=11/03/2022&pickUpTime=10:00:00&dropOffTime=10:00:00&pickuploc=airport&difflocation=&dropoffloc=airport&pos=1).
  - This option for three weeks: 452€.
- [200€: Pingouin Car Rental, Kia Picanto with GPS](https://www.carrental-mauritius.com/).
- [314€: Europcar, Kia Picanto Automatic with GPS](https://www.europcar.com/)
- [330€: Sixt.Com, Kia Picanto with GPS](https://www.sixt.com/funnel/#/reservation/offerconfig?wakz=EUR).

Gasoline is cheaper than in Denmark. Adding some gasoline costs, on average, the cost can be set in **500€ = 3.800 DKK**.

> Note: In Mauritius, they drive by the **[left](https://mauritiusattractions.com/driving-in-mauritius-i-62.html)**.

### By Taxi

- [Viator](https://www.viator.com/Trou-dEau-Douce-tours/Transfers-and-Ground-Transport/d24101-g15). From/To the Airport about **350 DKK** (or less).

## Food :cake:

Expenses in food can be the same, or cheaper than here in Denmark.

<div class="page"/>

## Budget :euro:

In the island they use the **Mauritian rupee** where `100 DKK = 668,96 MRU`.

```txt
Flights         12.000 DKK
AirBNB           4.400 DKK (three weeks)
Car              3.800 DKK (one week)
Extra Costs      3.800 DKK

Total:          24.000 DKK
```

So, we should pay around **12.000 DKK** by each.
