## Dates :calendar:

Around **three weeks**, from **Friday, 4th of March** to **Sunday, 27th of March** of 2022.

It is Mauritius' shoulder season, which means less humid, lower prices, less visitors, perfect for diving/snorkeling, but raining expected.

## Plan

### <font color=blue>Vero's plan</font>

Vero gets the **three weeks** of holidays, to enjoy running around the island :running:...

### <font color=blue>Abel's plan</font>

Abel works the **first week** over there and then gets **two weeks** of holidays.
Abel can work from the Valid's office in the island or from the Apartment (in case Wifi is enough good).

Abel's office is in [NeXTeracom Tower 1 @ Ebene area](https://www.google.com/maps/place/NeXTeracom+Tower+1,+Quatre+Bornes,+Mauritius/@-20.2429762,57.4872387,18.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x217c5ae1d1f68fc9:0xf67722ad33dc19d!8m2!3d-20.2424442!4d57.4884947).

## Weather :sunny:

- [Reference 1](https://www.holiday-weather.com/mauritius/averages/march/)
- [Reference 2](https://www.thomascook.com/holidays/weather/indian-ocean/mauritius/march/)
- [Reference 3](https://mauritiusattractions.com/mauritius-rainfall-in-mauritius-i-111.html)

March is the **wet session** so we should expect a lot of rains, with good temperature and humidity. But this depends on the region.

- Please, read it directly in the [Reference 3](https://mauritiusattractions.com/mauritius-rainfall-in-mauritius-i-111.html).
- Please, read about [the different regions here](https://www.mauritius.io/locations).

March is cyclones season, so it can happen two things: either it rains all the time or it is really good weather (with 30 degrees), but nothing is assured since is cyclones season.

## Flights :airplane:

Flights already booked with [Ticket.DK](https://www.ticket.dk/).

- From/To Valid Office (for visit or for working there one week).

### Renting Car

One week of simulation from 4th of March (10h00) to 11th of March (10h00), in the Airport.

- [172€: OLA, Perodua Axia with GPS and Assistance](https://www.olamauritius.com/en/step-3/?id=48&txtFromDate=04/03/2022&txtToDate=11/03/2022&pickUpTime=10:00:00&dropOffTime=10:00:00&pickuploc=airport&difflocation=&dropoffloc=airport&pos=1).

Gasoline is cheaper than in Denmark. Adding some gasoline costs, on average, the cost can be set in **500€ = 3.800 DKK**.

> Note: In Mauritius, they drive by the **[left](https://mauritiusattractions.com/driving-in-mauritius-i-62.html)**.

### By Taxi

- [Viator](https://www.viator.com/Trou-dEau-Douce-tours/Transfers-and-Ground-Transport/d24101-g15). From/To the Airport about **350 DKK** (or less).

## Food :cake:

Expenses in food can be the same, or cheaper than here in Denmark.

<div class="page"/>

## Budget :euro:

In the island they use the **Mauritian rupee** where `100 DKK = 668,96 MRU`.

```txt
Flights          7.000 DKK * 2 = 14.000 DKK
AirBNB           4.400 DKK (three weeks)
Car              3.800 DKK (one week)
Extra Costs      3.800 DKK

Total:          26.000 DKK
```

So, we should pay around **13.000 DKK** by each.
