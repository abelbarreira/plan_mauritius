  Hi Melwyn,

  I only write you just to let you know how is going.

  Me and my girlfriend are still planning our travel to Mauritius in March. We saw that there is probability of rains, but we still want to go to visit the island.

  In principle, my plan is working from the office during first week. We are renting an apartment in Rose Hill, which is less than 20 minutes walking to the office.
  The thing is that I would like to avoid driving a car in the center of the city, because I've never drove cars by the left, so I kind of prefer to going to the office walking or by bus.

  For the another two weeks, we are renting an AirBNB in the Trou aux Biches area.
  This area looks nice and the apartments over there are more affordable than in Flic En Flac.

  Roughly this, but we still have not booked anything, we will do the reservations this week, I guess.
  I will write you whenever I have something confirmed.

  Thanks a lot.

  And sorry about I'm disturbing you.
